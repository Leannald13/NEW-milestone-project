Project Name: Harrison Gunn: It's good to talk.

This project is inspired by my 13 year old nephew who runs a campaign with the aim to provide more mental health support to children and young people in the UK. Harrison has a podcast called
"It's good to talk", where he talks to celebrities and his peers about their experiences with mental health, body image and body confidence. Harrison focuses specifically on how how social media and the media
in general influences mental health and wellbeing. Harrison is also a BAFTA Kids presenter, interviewing celebrities on their latest projects. Harrison wants to spread his mental health campaign as far as possible
and I therefore decided to create this website to support his mission.

UX:
My aim for this website was to keep it simple. I wanted to it to be easy to use so that it would be suitable for children and adults. I therefore opted for a simple design without too much text.
This website is for children who can be inspired by Harrison's story, and sign the petition. I also wanted it to be for adults and professionals who may presenting opportunities, or professionals in 
the industry who are interested in taking part in Harrison's podcast and can make contact with him. I want the user to know who Harrison is, what he does, why he does it, and how to make contact with him/get involved.

Features:
The website contains a heading, footer and main section. Images, a navigation bar, paragraphs of content and a form for people to submit their details.

Existing Features:
Navbar - allows the user to move from page to page and each menu items is labelled appropriately so that the user knows what they are looking at.
Images - are there to provide a break up the page, add more colour and help the page look overall, more visually appealing. It is also a way for people to visually see Harrison's work experience and see the
events he has taken part in.
Social links - allows other ways for people to contact Harrison, follow him on social media and link directly to his podcast.
petition button - links directly to his petition for people to sign it. Social links and petition button are set to generate a blank page to prevent the user from losing their place on the webiste.
Form - a direct way for people to contact Harrison. This form is not linked to an email address.
Paragraphs of text - these have been put into boxes to make it more visually appealing for the user, break up the page and make it look tidier.

Features left to implement:
- I would like to make the form link to an email address
- I would like to add perhaps moving animation or some youtube videos of Harrison recording the podcast live. I would do this to ensure that this website heavily tailored towards a
younger audience. The colors and the layout is perhaps quite mature for a 13 year old, therefore I would like to add more visual items and animation for the purpose of the younger audience.

Technologies used:
I used:
HTML5 - https://html.com/ - the use of HTML was a requirement for this project. I used it to put together the content of my webpage and define the layout.
CSS3 - http://www.css3.info/ - the use of CSS was a requirement for this project. I used it to style the HTML layout.
Bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/ - I used bootsrap to help me lay out the structure of my page with its' grid system. I also used it for my form, nav bar, and petition button.
Font Awesome - https://fontawesome.com/ - I used font awesome on my 'home page' to break up the text with a symbol of a child. This was to try to make the page look more visually appealing and "fun".
Google Fonts - https://fonts.google.com/ - I wanted to use "raleway" as my font, and I therefore needed to take this from google fonts.

Testing:
I tested the site continously throughout the project. Each change, edit or development I made, I checked how this would function on a mobile device to ensure it looked how I wanted it to. I have tested each of the links to ensure
that they work. 
The majority of bugs I encountered throughout the project was to do with something small like a typo. I felt that my greatest challenge was getting my padding and margins correct so that everything
still looked the way it should when I checked it on a mobile device.
After regularly testing of the site, I feel confident the links work correctly.

Deployment:
I used github to deploy my code. I pushed the repository regularly so that I could always locate it if for any reason my computer crashed or somehow my code stopped working.
I am pleased that I did as I do encounter a few problems with AWS Cloud9 during my project where I was unable to access my environments and if this happened on a weekend,
I was not in a position to contact the office to have it resolved. However, having it github means I could accesss it. I tried hard to make each commit clearly demonstrate what it was that I was deploying. 
My github repository for this project contains my files: index.html, general.html, contact.html, images, README.md and my CSS files which contains my style.css file.

Media:
The images that I used came from Harrison. They were photos that were taken for him on his own camera while he took part in various events. The images were taken from his Instagram account.

Acknowledgements:
I recieved inspiration for this project from my nephew who despite having Aspergers and ADHD is already doing amazing work in the world, despite being only 13 years old. If I can use my skills as a developer
for a good cause and contribute to the world in a positive way, then I believe it is a project worth doing.

Credits:
Statistics for the number of children with a mental health disorder, written on the "home page" was taken from: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/mental-health-children-nhs-england-depression-anxiety-report-young-people-a8646211.html
I used aspects of the code from my previous tutorial from The Code Institute where we created a resume website for someone by the name of Rosie. I used it for:
-The footer and creating my social links. 
-To create my font awesome icons on the "home page" and then I edited the code for my specfications.
-I took the "logo" css code from the Rosie website for the main image at the top of the site and edited it to my specifications.
-I also used some of the code to create my form on the "Let's Talk" page, and then amended the code for my specifications.
I watched Youtube videos by someone called The Net Ninja: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg this developed my understanding of the bootstrap grid system.
The content on the "About me" was from Harrison, and I reworded it slightly.
